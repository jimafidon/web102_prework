## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The hardest challenge was understanding some of the DOM elements and stateless variables that you had to use. I am not used to not being able to physically see changes within the code so utilizing Dev Tools more was a challenge for me. On top of that, it took me a while to truly understand the inner html display that we had to write and embed inside, only because embedding things in JavaScript is something I am just not yet used to. 

Another challenge I faced was self doubt. I learned javascript through an online bootcamp like course which was self taught. I originally started working through this earlier on in the summer but frustration got the best of me and I gave up. I really regretted doing so afterwards and tried moving forward. Once I saw the email saying the deadline was extended I saw it as a second chance for me and spent all day working through this. I am really proud of myself for finishing and sticking through with it in the end.
